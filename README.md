### Hacking procedure

"...Mickey, he's the Steel Man and now we'll give a hacking demonstration against a database that contains military data, we’ll later give the data we’re going to retrieve to alternative media circuits. 
So in this moment we’re connected through a packet network that allowed us to contact an American service that distributes data, BIX, which is one of the most popular networks in the USA.
Now it’s asking me for a password. We managed to find it through a generator. We’re beginning to enter the system, and the system asks me if I want to pay: I say yes. 
In this moment it’s asking me how I want to pay: Credit card, Corporate bank account or a personal bank account. I say I want to pay with a credit card.
Which credit card: I say visa.
It asks for the bank name: I type in Swiss Bank
It asks me the credit card number: The credit card number must be carefully evaluated. it’s composed by 3 groups of numbers which indicate the credit card origin, the card type (gold, silver etc..) and how much you can spend. I type in this number.. it asks me if it’s correct…it tells me that the credit card number is authorized. Now I’m authorized to enter and use any service provided by BIX. I ask to enter the database service. It asks me for what I’m searching, for subject, for date, for keyword. I tell him for subject.
The subject that I’m going to ask is “weapons”. Ok now here’s this title “Attention, this area contains classified information, enter the special access code” We took 3 days to break through this barrier.
Your request has been accepted there are 8 items. I immediately connect to (GENS??) which is one of the biggest databases about military and it also acts often as a mediator between USA and URSS on disarmament. The item is “3” and the computer is now saying me that there are 8 types of arguments available, I ask for the defence projects status, which it is number 4. 
This is the list of arguments available I want to see them all. It begins with the description of every single weapon, who are the main buyers, the connections with the government and the technologies that are used..screen after screen it prints the various types of weapons.
Wait a disturb came in, output is suspended, careful.. maybe they’re tracking us…


THEY’RE TRACKING US, OFF! OFF! OFF"
